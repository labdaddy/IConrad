#### To Install Foreman
-  Foreman requires puppet to be installed on the system first.
- To install puppet: `sudo yum -y install https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm`
- Foreman [quickstart guide](https://theforeman.org/manuals/2.1/quickstart_guide.html).
- NOTE: From the Foreman/ Katello page [here](https://theforeman.org/plugins/katello/3.16/installation/index.html): If you want to manage content (for example, RPMs, Kickstart trees, ISO and KVM images, OSTree content, and more) with Foreman please follow the [Katello installation instructions](https://theforeman.org/plugins/katello/). If you are a new user, ensure that you familiarize yourself with Katello and decide whether you want to use its features because installing Katello on top of an existing Foreman is unsupported. Note that you cannot install Katello on Debian systems.
