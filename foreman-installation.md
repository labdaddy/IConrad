#### To Install Foreman
-  Foreman requires puppet to be installed on the system first.
- To install puppet: `sudo yum -y install https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm`
- Foreman [quickstart guide](https://theforeman.org/manuals/2.1/quickstart_guide.html).
- NOTE: From the Foreman/ Katello page, you must install Katello WITH Foreman. Katello cannot be installed after the fact. [Link.](https://theforeman.org/plugins/katello/3.16/installation/index.html) I am stating here because this is not made explicitly clear in the Foreman docs, in fact it is presented as optional.
