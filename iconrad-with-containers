##### IConrad enterprise setup with Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform and AWS instead of a bunch of VM's

1.Set up a KVM hypervisor.
- This step remains the same

2. ~~Inside of that KVM hypervisor, install a Spacewalk server. Use CentOS 6 as the distro for all work below. (For bonus points, set up errata importation on the CentOS channels, so you can properly see security update advisory information.)~~
- Instead, use CentOS 7, and install Foreman-Katello.
